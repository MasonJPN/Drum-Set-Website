# Drum-Set-Website
A simple interactive drum kit built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Users can play different drum sounds either by clicking the on-screen buttons or by pressing corresponding keys on the keyboard. Each interaction triggers the correct sound and a visual button animation for feedback.



I was able to practice working with things such as:
-Event Listeners
-DOM Manipulation 
-JS audio and img external libraries
